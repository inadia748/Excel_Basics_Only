1. How Excel treats text, times and dates data

- In C4, put 57.   We notice, 57,which is a number, is right aligned
- In F4, put 'apple'. We notice, 'apple', which is a text, is left aligned
- In I4, put 12:00PM.
- In I5, put 21:00
Now, copy cell I4 and I5, first select using shift + down arrow, then ctrl + c,
then click on J4 and then under Home tab, there is paste option on J4 and J5, 
click on 'paste special' or use the shortcut for paste special,
'ctrl + alt + v', then press on values.
We notice that on J4 and J5, it is storing those values as decimals.


On american format, date is in the format of 'month-day-year'.
- In K4, put the date on american format, 1/1/2018.
- In K5, put the date on american format, 1/1/2022.
- In K6, put the date on american format, 1/1/1900.

Again, select the cells K4, K5 and K6. copy them by ctrl + c. then click on
L4 cell
Then, use the shortcut for paste special by 'ctrl + alt + v', and then 
press on values.

Again, select the cells K4, K5 and K6. press 'ctrl + 1', and select 'date' and then
press on the date format you desire
We notice that on L4, L5 and L6, the dates are stored those values as numbers.






2. Change the case of a text
- Select A3 cell and B3 cell, then on C3 cell, put '=upper(A3)' and 
on D3 cell, put '=upper(B3)'.
- Now, select from C3 cell and drag it all the way to the bottom to apply the
upper case formula.
- Again, select from D3 cell and drag it all the way to the bottom to apply the
upper case formula.

- On E3 cell, put '=lower(A3)' and on F3 cell, put '=lower(B3)'.
-Now, select from E3 cell and drag it all the way to the bottom to apply the
lower case formula.
- Again, select from F3 cell and drag it all the way to the bottom to apply the
lower case formula.

- On G3 cell, put '=proper(A3)' and on H3 cell, put '=proper(B3)'.
-Now, select from G3 cell and drag it all the way to the bottom to apply the
proper case formula.
-Again, select from H3 cell and drag it all the way to the bottom to apply the
lower case formula.






3. Combining Strings of Text Together.

- On C8 cell, put ='C2 - C4', we shift backward the days by 90 days.


Go to 'Purchases' sheet and then again go to 'Sheet1'.
In Sheet1,
- On D15 cell, 
put '=COUNTIF(Purchases!$A$2:$A$2001,"<"&Sheet1!$D$12+Sheet1!C15)'.

-On D17 cell,
put '=COUNTIF(Purchases!$A$2:$A$2001,"<"&Sheet1!$D$12+Sheet1!C17)'.

- On D19 cell,
put =COUNTIF(Purchases!$A$2:$A$2001,"<"&Sheet1!$D$12+Sheet1!C19)'.










10. Compiling Montly and Annual Totals.

Aim is to find out which month and year has more sales with purchases.

Go to 'Purchases' Sheet
- On B2 cell, put '=month(Select cell A2)'.
Select cell B2 and drag it till the bottom so the month formula is applied.

- On C2 cell, put '=year(Select cell A2)'.
Select cell C2 and drag it till the bottom so that year formula is applied.


Go to 'Sheet1'

-On D2 cell, put '=countif('select the cells under month from Purchases Sheet',
 select C2 cell from Sheet1).
Select D2 till D13, copy, then ctrl + alt + v, then click 'formulae'.

- On I2 cell, put '=countif('select the cells under year from Purchase Sheet', 
select H2 cell from Sheet1).
Copy I2 cell, then select from I2 cell till the bottom, then press,
ctrl + alt + v, then press formula.












11.Conducting Day of the Week Analysis.

Go to Sheet1.

- On D2 cell, put '=countif('select the cells under Day of Week from Purchases, select C2 cell from Sheet1).
copy D2 cell and select till D8, then ctrl + alt + v, then press formula.







12. Combining Date with Time Data.

- On D2 cell, put '=C2+B2'. It will give us datetime.
After that on the side of D2, click two times. All the corresponding
formulas will be applied throught the cell.

- On D2 cell, press 'ctrl + shift + down arrow', then press 'ctrl + 1',
go to 'customs', then click on m/d/yyyy h:mm, then customize it like this
m/d/yyyy h:mm AM/PM.

- To sort the column 'DateTime' only and if you want to get rid of 'Date'
and 'Time' column, remember that 'DateTime' depends on 'Time' and 'Date'.

So, inorder to perform operations on the cells under 'DateTime', you need to
copy those cells under 'DateTime', First select and then ctrl + c.
Later, on under the same column 'DateTime', 'ctrl + alt + v', press 'values'.

Now, delete the columns of 'Date' and 'Time' along will all its data.

You see there will not effect on DateTime, since you copy and pasted it on the same column of 'DateTime'.

- Select all the data under the columns of 'Registration' and 'DateTime' from A1 to B2000, then
to Data tab, Data-> Sort, select 'DateTime' and 'Oldest to Newest'.

Congratulations, now we see the sorted value.









13-Adding and Subtracting Time.

Go to Sheet1:

We notice that there is Registration ID and Registration Time. Our aim is to add
4hours as a reminder to those IDs attending a webinar.

All the cells under 'Registration Time' is in integer and when you put under
'Reminder Sent' , '=B2 + 4', it will give you after 4 days. 
We do not want that, we only want to update the time, not the days.
So, in C2 cell, put '=B2 + "4:00", it will update the time after 4 hours.


Another way of doing is, in E2 cell, put '4:00'.

then again, in C2 cell, put 'B2 + $E$2', we are anchoring them incase, we 
decide the change it to 5:00 or 10:00, it is the best way.

Now, on the corner of C2, double click so that all the formulas are applied 
across the cell.



Go to Sheet2:

To calculate the 'Average time between registration', we need to sort them.
Inorder to do that, select the cells under 'Registration ID' and 'Registration Time',
from A2: B2000, go to Data->Sort, then select 'Registration Time' and sort it 
from 'Oldest' to 'Newest'.

- In C3 cell, put '=B3-B2', it will give us the 'Time Between Registration'.
Then, double click on the corner of C3 cell, so that the formula is applied 
throughout the 'Time Between Registration'.

Then select the cells from C3 till the bottom, then, press 'ctrl + 1',
go to time, then select in 24hour format, like 13:30.

Now to go to E2 cell, put '=average(Select the cells under 'Time Between Registration').











14-Conducting Hours of the Day Analysis.


Go to Sheet1:

Our aim is to calculate the number of registrations from certain hours of the day.
Like, what is the number of registrations between 12:00 AM to 3:00 AM.

Now, go to Sheet2:

We need a numerical value for DateTime Value.
- In C2 cell, put '=numbervalue(B2)', it will give us the numerical value.
Doubleclick on C2 cells so that the formula of numerical value is applied 
under 'DateTime Value'.

So, the datetime value is in fractional, since, we are only working with the 
time, we need to eliminate the day. Inorder to do that,

- In D2 cell, put '=C2 - int(C2)'. This will give us the time portion.
Then double-click on the side of D2 cell, so that the formula is applied 
throught the cells under column 'Time Only'.
select all the cells under 'TimeOnly', then 'ctrl + 1', click time and select
'1:30PM'.



Now, go to Sheet1:

countifs allows to have multiple checks.

-Our first criteria is the range that is the cells under Time Only under 'Sheet2'.
- first criteria should be greater than the time coming under 'From' column.
- Second criteria is that the range is less than the time coming under 'To' column.

- In E3 cell, put '=COUNTIFS(Sheet2!$D$2:$D$2000,">"&'Sheet 1'!C3,Sheet2!$D$2:$D$2000,"<"&'Sheet 1'!D3)'.
- Double-click on E3 cell, you will notice the formula is applied throught the cells under
'# of Registrations'.
