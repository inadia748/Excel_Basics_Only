 What is Statistics?
Gather Data, Prepare Data, Analyze Data and Interpret Data. Then, we draw some
insights after these steps.

Types of Statistics:
1) Descriptive Statistics.
2) Inferential Statistics.


Descriptive Statistics:
Collecting, organizing, summarizing and presenting data. It tends to 
focus on areas like:
- Measures of Central Tendency like mean, median, mode or quartiles.
- Measures of dispersion like standard deviation and variance. It helps us
understand how the data points are distributed and also range.



Inferential Statistics.
Drawing conclusions about a population based on sample data.






1- Mean, Median and Mode

Go to sheet1,

- In I2 cell,
 put '=sum('Select the cells under Quantity') / count('select the cells under Quantity).
	or
another way to do that, put '=average(Select the cells under Quantity)'.
This is to find the mean or average of the Quantity.

- In J2 cell, 
put '=average('Select the cells under Order Value'). 
This is to find the average of Order Value.

- In I3 cell, 
put = 'median('Select the cells under Quantity'). This is to find the median of 
Quantity.

- In J3 cell, 
put '=median('Select the cells under Order Value'). This is to find the median of 
Order Value.

- In I4 cell, 
put '=mode('Select the cells under Quantity'). This is to find the mode of the 
Quantity. Which value appears frequently.

- In J4 cell, 
put '=mode('Select the cells under Order Value'). This is to find the mode of the 
mode of the Order Value.


- In I8 cell, put '=mode('Select the cells under Unit Price').

- In I9 cell, put '=mode('Select the cells under Customer ID').

- In I10 cell, put '=mode('Select the cells under Order ID').

- In I11 cell, put '=mode('Select the cells under Case Type').

We notice, in I10 and I11 cell, there will be an error. 
Because, mode cannot calculate letters, it can calculate numeric values in case of 'Case Type'.
and mode cannot calculate for Order ID because it is full of unique values,
so mode cannot calculate that.



Go to Sheet2:

- In D4 cell, put '14'.
- In D5 cell, put '8'.
- In D6 cell, put '6'.
- In D7 cell, put '2'.
- In D8 cell, put '10'.

- In G3 cell, put '=average('Select the cells under Hot Dogs in 10 minutes').
- In G4 cell, put '=median('Select the cells under Hot Dogs in 10 minutes').







2- Percentile and Percentile Rank

- In G2 cell, put '= percentrank.exc('Select the cells under Order Value' then press F4 inorder to anchor it, select F2 as a reference).

- In K8 cell, put '=percentile.exc('Select the cells under Quantity' then press F4, select J8).
- In K9 cell, put '=percentile.exc('Select the cells under Quantity' then press F4, select J9).
-In K10 cell, put '=percentile.exc('Select the cells under Quantity' then press F4, select J10).
-In K11 cell, put '=percentile.exc('Select the cells under Quantity' then press F4, select J11).
-In K12 cell, put '=percentile.exc('Select the cells under Quantity' then press F4, select J12).



- In K16 cell, put '=percentile.exc('Select the cells under Order Value then press F4, select J16).
- In K17 cell, put '=percentile.exc('Select the cells under Order Value then press F4, select J17).
- In K18 cell, put '=percentile.exc('Select the cells under Order Value then press F4, select J18).
- In K19 cell, put '=percentile.exc('Select the cells under Order Value then press F4, select J19).
- In K20 cell, put '=percentile.exc('Select the cells under Order Value then press F4, select J20).








3- Frequency Distributions or Data Dense.

- In J8 cell, put '= max('Select the cells under Order Value').
- In J9 cell, put '= min('Select the cells under Order Value').

- In I13 cell, put '$500'.
- In I14 cell, put '$1000'.
- In I15 cell, put '$1500'.
- In I16 cell, put '$2000'.
- In I17 cell, put '$2500'.

- Select all the cells from J13 to J17, then go to the formula
function, put '= frequency('Select the cells under Order Value then press F4, select the cells from
I13 to I17) then press 'ctrl + shift + enter'.

Now, select cells from I12 to J17, then go to Data->Data Analysis -> Histogram.
then in Histogram, for Input Range, 'Select the cells under Order Value'.
and for Bin Range, 'Select the cells under Bins'. Then, click on 'Output Range': 'Select the cells I20'.

Then, tick on Chart Output, then press OK.

Then, go to Chart Design and select your preferred design.









4- Standard Deviation and Variance.

In Sheet1:
- In K2 cell, put '=average('Select the cells under Order Value').
- In G2 cell, put '= select F2 cell - Select K2 cell, then press F4.
Right click on G2 cell so that the formula is appied througout the cells.
- In H2 cell, put '= G2 ^2'. Double-click on H2 cell so that the formula is applied throught the bottom.

- In K3 cell, put '=sum(Select the cells under Squared)/count(Select the cells under Order Value).

- In K4 cell, put '=sqrt(K3)'. This gives standard deviation.

- In K8 cell, put '=var.p(Select the cells under Order Value'). This gives us variance.

- In K9 cell, put '=stdev.p(Select the cells under Order Value'). This gives us standard deviation.

Here, you are finding the variance and standard deviance of Order Value.

Repeat the same process in Sheet 2.  You will be finding the variance and standard deviance of Quantity.








5- Trends in Data.

We have daily revenues of an ecommerce sales.

- In G2 cell, put '= averageif('Select the cells under Day of the Week then press F4, Select F2, Select the cells under Revenue then press F4). This
gives average daily revenue on monday.
Now, double click on G2 cell, so that the formula is applied throught the cells.

- In H2 cell, put '= G2/ sum(select the cells under Avg Daily Revenue)'.
Double click on H2 cell, so that the formula is applied through out.


- In G11, put '=averageif('Select the cells under Month then press F4, F11, 'Select the cells under Daily Revenue' then press F4).
- In H11, put '= G11/sum(select the cells under Avg Daily Revenue).











6- Introduction to Correlation.

- In H3 cell, put '=correl( Select the cells under Daily Revenue, Select the 
cells under # of Orders)'. The correlation is between daily revenue and # of Orders.

- In H4 cell, put '=correl( Select the cells under Daily Revenue, Select the 
cells under Joe 's FB posts). This is the correlation between daily revenue and Joe 's FB posts.

Now, go to Data tab, Data -> Data Analysis -> Select correlation, for input range: 'Select all three columns under Daily Revenue,
# of Orders and Joe 's FB post'. -> tick on Labels in First Row. - On output range, click on any desired cells to show the output.
