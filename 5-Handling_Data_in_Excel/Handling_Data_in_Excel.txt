1- LookUp with VlookUp.
- In K2 cell, put '=vlookup(Select the J2 cell, Select the table from A2 to H381 then press F4, 2, False).
Since, campaign in 2nd column thats we put '2' in the vlook up.

- In L2 cell, put '=vlookup(Select the J2 cell, Select the table from A2 to H381 then press F4, 7, False).
Since, campaign in 7th column thats we put '7' in the vlook up.
Double click on L2 cell so that the formula is applied till the bottom.

- In K2 cell, put '=vlookup(Select the J2 cell, Select the table from A2 to H381 then press F4, 8, False).
Since, campaign in 8th column thats we put '8' in the vlook up.
Double click on K2 cell so that the formula is applied till the bottom.

Vlookup works for both numbers and text.



2- LookUp with HLOOKUP

- In M4 cell, put '=HLOOKUP(L4,$B$3:$J$9,4,FALSE)'. Discount is in 4th row.
Double click on M4 cell so that the formula is applied till the bottoms.

- In N4 cell, put '=HLOOKUP(L4,$B$3:$J$9,7,FALSE)'. Total is in 7th row.
Double click on N4 cell so that the formula is applied till the bottoms.

- In O4 cell, put '=M4/N4', this will give percentage of signups from discount.
double click on O4 cell so that the formula is applied till the bottoms.






3- Name Arrays for Reuse and Readability.

Go to 'marketing_perf' sheet
-Select the entire table from A1 to H381. then go to Formulas tab.
Formula -> Define Name -> In Name, write 'Marketing_Perf', then click ok and close. 
or press ctrl + F3 then press 'new' then go to Define Name -> In Name, write 'Marketing_Perf',
then click 'ok' and 'close'.

- Go to cell K2, press F2, then instead of '$A$1 to $H$381, just write 'Marketing_Perf'.
- Similarly in L2 and M2, instead of '$A$1 to $H$381, just write 'Marketing_Perf'.


Go to 'signups' sheet.

- Select the entire table from B3 to J9, then press 'ctrl + F3', then click on 'new',
then go to Define Name -> in Name, write 'SignUps'. then click ok and close.

- In M4 cell, press F2, then instead of '$A$1 to $J$9, just write 'SignUps'. Double click on M4 cell so that the formula is applied till the bottom.
- Similarly in N2, instead of '$A$1 to $J$9, just write 'SignUps'. Double click on N4 cell so that the formula is applied till the bottom.










4- Group Records with Nested If statements.

Our aim is to group them based on a certain values.
Example:- How much it costs to generate a sign up for the website?

- In I2 cell, put '= H2/E2'. It gives cost per sign up.
Doubleclick on I2 cell so that the formula is applied to the bottom .

low cost: $0 to $0.50
medium cost: $0.50 to $1.50
high cost: $1.50+

- In J2 cell, put '=if(I2 <= 0.50, "low", if(I2 <= 1.50, "Medium", "high")).

- In K2 cell, put '= G2/F2'. It is sales per conversion. Double click on K2 cell so that the 
formula is applied till the bottom.

low: <= $75
med: <= $200
high: > $200

-In L2 cell, put '=IF(K2 <= 75, "low", IF(K2 <= 200, "medium", "high")).
	Doubleclick on L2 cell so that the formula is applied through out the bottom.













5- Avoid Errors with IF and ISNUMBER.

- ctrl + F, write '#DIV/0', you will some errors.

Inorder to avoid that error,

- In I2 cell, put '= if(E2 > 0, H2/E2, ""). This will avoid the error.
double click on I2 cell so the formula is applied till the bottom.

- In J2 cell , put '=IF(ISNUMBER(I2), IF(I2 <=0.5, "low",  IF(I2 <=1.5, "medium", "high")),"UNTESTED")'

- In K2 cell, put '= IF( G2 > 0, G2/F2, "")'. double click on K2 cell so that the formula is 
applied till the bottom.

- In L2 cell, put '=IF(K3<=75,"Low",IF(K3<=200,"Medium","High")), "Untested")'. double click on L2 cell so
that the formula is applied till the bottom.











6- Create Dropdown Lists for Filtering.

Dropdown lists are used for creating dashboards.

-  Click on C3 cell, then Go to Data -> Data Validation -> list, 
for the sources , go to 'signups' sheet, select cell from C3 to I3. 
Then click ok.

- Go to E3 cell, put '= countif(go to 'marketing_perf' sheet then select the cells under category, go to the dashboard and click on C3 cell).
In E3 cell, put '=COUNTIF(marketing_perf!C2:C381,dashboard!C3)'.

- In C6 cell,put '= sumif(go to 'marketing_perf' sheet then select the cells under Category column, Go to the dashboard then click on C3, go to 'marketing_perf' sheet and select the cells under Ad cost).
Like this, '=SUMIF(marketing_perf!C2:C381,dashboard!C3, marketing_perf!H2:H381)

- Go to 'marketing_perf' sheet, go to column 'Category' and select all the cells under it. 
then press, 'Ctrl + F3', click 'new', write 'Category'. 

Then in cell C6, put ' =SUMIF(Category,dashboard!C3, marketing_perf!H2:H381)'.
also in E3 cell, put '= COUNTIF(Category,dashboard!C3)'.


- Click on J3 cell, then go to Data -> Data Validation -> list, in sources, go to 'signup' sheet, select cells from
B4 to B9. 












7- Create Unique Lists.

Go to 'marketing_perf' sheet, select the cells under Category and then copy them by 'ctrl + c'.
Then go to 'misc' sheet, and paste them by 'ctrl + v' under Unique Category.
Select all the cells under Unique Category and then go to Data->Remove Duplicates.
Then select all cells on Unique Category from A1 to A8, then go to Data -> Sort -> Select A to Z.

Go to 'marketing_perf' sheet, select the cells under Campaign and then copy them by 'ctrl + c'.
Then go to 'misc' sheet, and paste them by 'ctrl + v' under Unique Campaign.
Select all the cells under Unique Category and then go to Data-> Remove Duplicates.
Then select all cells on Unique Campaign from C1 to C8, then go to Data -> Sort -> Select A to Z.

Go to 'dashboard' sheet, click on C3 cell, then click on Data-> Data Validation -> Select the cells on 'misc' sheet under Unique Categories.
Go to 'dashboard' sheet, click on J3 cell, then click on Data -> Data Validation -> Select the cells on 'misc' sheet under Unique Campaigns.


To check if a column is unique or not:
- Go to 'marketing_perf' sheet, then select the cells under Unique Key Phrases.
then go to Data -> Remove Duplicates. You can see whether that column has duplicates or not.














8- Fast Lookup with Index and Match.

Index and Match is much faster and needed when tables get bigger than 
vlookup and hlookup.

- In P2 cell, put '=index('select cells from E2 to H2, 2)'. It gives us the second value since we put '2'.

- In P3 cell, put '=index('select cells from H2 to H5, 3)'. It gives us the third value since we put '3'.

-In P4 cell, put '=index('select cells from A2 to H5, 2, 3)'. It gives us the second row since we put '2' and 3rd column since we put '3'.

- In P5 cell,put '=index('marketing_perf', 4), It will give use reference error. It needs 2 indices inorder to be correct.

- In P6 cell, put '=index('marketing_perf', 4, 7), It will give us 4th row since we put '4' and 7th column since we put '7'.

- In P7 cell, put '=index('marketing_headers', 2). It gives us second value since we put '2'.



Match returns an index inside a row.

- In P9 cell, put '=match("cheap designer clothes", select cells from A2 to A9, 0). It gives us 4, since it is the 4th element from A2 to A9 cells.

- In P10 cell, put '=match("Signups", marketing_headers, 0). It gives us 5, since it is the 5th element in marketing headers.

- In P12 cell, put 'diaper bag'
- In P13 cell, put 'Sales'

- In P15 cell, put '=vlookup(P12, marketing_perf, 7, false), 7 because Sales in in 7th column.

- In P16 cell, put '=INDEX(MARKETING_PERF, MATCH(P12, UNIQUE_KEYPHRASES, 0), MATCH(P13, MARKETING_HEADERS, 0))'.








9- Multi-Condition Lookup with DSUM

- In J10 cell, put '=DSUM(MARKETING_PERF, "Ad Cost", J3:L4).
- In J3, K3 and L3 which is of the columns Category, Campaign and Sales,
Under Category column, in J4, write 'General'. 
Under Campaign column, in K4, write 'None'.
Under Sales column, in L4, write '<500'.


- In J6 cell, put '=dcounta(marketing_perf, "Unique_Keyphrases", select from J3 to M4).









10- Create Rankings with Small and Large.

Go to 'marketing_perf' sheet, go to 'Signups' column, select the cells under
'Signups' and press 'Ctrl + F3', then write 'SIGNUPS'.

- In E383 cell, put '=MAX(SIGNUPS)'.
- In E384 cell, put '=LARGE(SIGNUPS, 1)'.
- In E385 cell, put '=LARGE(SIGNUPS, 2)'.
- In E386 cell, put '=LARGE(SIGNUPS, 11)'.
- In E387 cell, put '=SMALL(SIGNUPS, 11)'.

Go to 'dashboard' sheet,

- In F10 cell, put '=Large(if(category = click on cell C3 then press F4, signups, ""),1) then press 'ctrl + shift + enter'.
- In F11 cell, put '=Large(if(category = click on cell C3 then press F4, signups, ""),2) then press 'ctrl + shift + enter'.
- In F12 cell, put '=Large(if(category = click on cell C3 then press F4, signups, ""),3) then press 'ctrl + shift + enter'.
