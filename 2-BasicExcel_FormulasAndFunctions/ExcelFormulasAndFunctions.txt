Basic Math Functions in Excel

Note:
a)'ctrl + shift + down-arrow', will select the columns under one block 
like orderId, customer Id, Product type, unit price, quantity and order value.

b) 'ctrl + shift + right-arrow', will select the rows from left to right.



1) In F2 cell, put '=E2*D2'

To do it for the rest of the cell down for Order Value,
hover over to F2 cell, and double click, it will fill out the 
value for Order value.

2) In column I1, put '=count( 'select the number of columns under Quantity')
  by select the column of Quantity, put 'shift + arrow-down'
	It will count number values. this count function will 
	count the columns under unit price, quantity, ordervalue
        and customer id. It will not count the number of product types.



In K1 cell,
To count the number of product type, put 'counta(select the number of 
columns under Product type)'.  
'counta' is for used for counting columns or rows when letters are inputed.
to select the column, put 'ctrl + shift + down-arrow'. 


3) In I3 cell, put '=sum('Select under Order value')'.










Conditional Math Functions:

# of Orders.
1) In I7 cell, put '=countif(select all the columns under Product_Type by
'ctrl + shift + down-key' then press 'F4 key', H7), press Enter. 
H7 is for iPhone8.

2) In I8 cell, put '=countif(select all the columns under Product_Type by
'ctrl + shift + down-key' then press 'F4 key', H8), press Enter. 
H8 is for iPhone8s.
You are counting the number of iphone8

3) In I9 cell, put '=countif(select all the columns under Product_Type by
'ctrl + shift + down-key' then press 'F4 key', H9), press Enter. 
H9 is for iPhoneX.

or when you apply the formula on I7 and to apply the formula for the 
rest of the cells like I8 and I9,  hover over I7 cell and click till I9 and 
double click them.

4) In I10, put '=sum('select the cells from I7 to I9)'.


Quantity Ordered.
1) In J7, '=sumif('select the cells from product type then press F4', H7, 
		'select the cells from Quantity then press F4'),
	H7 for iPhone8.
sum if is used to calculate the total number of iphone8 available.
Do it similary for J8 and J9. Simply hover around J7 and click till J9,
You will get the total number of iPhone8s and iPhoneX.


Order Value.
1) In  K7 cell, put '=sumif('select the cells from product type then press 
F4', H7, 'select the cells from Order Value then press F4').
	H7 for iPhone8.
you are finding the total order value for iPhone8.
Do it similary for K8 and K9. Simply hover around K7 and click till K9,
You will get the total number of iPhone8s and iPhoneX.







Min, Max, and Average Functions:

1) In I2 cell, put '=min( select the columns under quantity)', will give you 
minimum among quantity.
2) In I3 cell, put '=max(select the columns under quantity)', will give you 
maximum under quantity.
3) In I4, put '=average(select the columns under quantity)', will give you
average of the quantity.

4) In J2 cell, put '=min(select the columns under order value)', will give the 
minimum among order value.

5) In J3 cell, put '=min(select the columns under order value)', will give the 
minimum among order value.

6) In J4 cell, put '=average(select the columns under order value)', will give the 
average among order value.

7) In I8 cell, put '=averageif(select the columns under product type then press 
	F4, I7, select the columns under quantity then press F4).
	I7 is for iPhone 8
   You are calculating the average order quantity for Iphone8.

8) In I9 cell, put '=averageif(select the columns under product type then press 
	F4, I7, select the columns under order value then press F4).
	I7 is for iPhone 8
   You are calculating the average order value for Iphone8.







Logical Operators And Functions:

 
1) In I4 cell, write 12,500.
2) In I5 cell, write $25,000 or $35000.

Checking if 'Actual Total Order Quantity is greater than Target Total
Order Quantity':
1) In I9 cell, put ' =IF(I1 > I4, TRUE, FALSE).
	I1 is Actual Total Quantity and I4 is Target Total Quantity.

Checking if 'Actual Total Order Value is greater than Target Total Order Value':
2) In I10 cell, put '=IF(I2 > I5, TRUE, FALSE).


3) In I12 cell, put '=IF(AND(I9,I10),TRUE,FALSE)


4) In I14 cell, put '=IF(OR(I9,I10),TRUE,FALSE)

5) In I17 cell, put '=I1-I4', you are getting the difference between Actual
Total Order Quantity and Target Total Order Quantity.

6) In I18 cell, put '=I2-I5', you are getting the difference between Actual Total
Order Value and Target Total Order Value.

7) In J17 cell, put 'IF(I17>0,"Units Over Target", "Units Below Target")'.

8) In J18 cell, put 'IF(I18>0, "Dollars Over Target", Dollars Below Target")'.









Anchoring Cell References and Name:

In Anchoring Sheet,
1) In B6 cell, put '=B1' and hover over it and drag it till E9. We see A1, no 
anchoring.

2) In B11 cell, put '=$B1' and hover over it and drag it till E14. We see, $A1,
column anchoring. Column anchoring, the columns have row values and row remains 
the same or are fixed.

3) In B16 cell, put '=B$1' and hover over it and drag it till E19. We see, A$1,
row anchoring, the rows have column values and columns remains the same or are 
fixed.

4) In B21 cell, put '=$B$1' and hover over it and drag it till E24. We can, see,
$A$1, it will have same values for rows and columns.

In Naming Sheet,
1) In I2, put '(9%)'.
I2 is the tax rate.

You want to apply the tax rate to all the sales tax, so you have to anchor them.
2) In G2 cell, put '=F2 * $I$2', you are referencing to $A$1 anchoring style.
Hover over G2 cell and drag it to the bottom.

This is done when you cannot directly change the tax rate on each cell, it is
very tiring. So, you are anchoring them.

3) In J8 cell, put '=sum(select the columns under Sales Tax)'
4) In K8 cell, put '=J5*I2', J5 is total sales value and I2 is tax rate.
5) Click on I2 cell, go to topleft corner and rewrite 'I2' as 'Tax_Rate' and then
  click on J5 cell, and go to topleft corner and rewrite 'J5' as 'Total_Order_Value'.
  Then go to L8 cell, put '=Tax_Rate(press Tab) * Total_Order_Value(press tab)'.








Array Functioning:

1)Instead of using 'sum function under the order value columns' in L2 cell, we can put '=sum(select the cells
under Quantity * select the cells under unit price)' and 
then press 'ctrl + shift + enter'. If you do not press 'ctrl + shift + enter',
the calculations will be enormously high which is not the correct value, that
is why 'ctrl + shift + enter ' is pressed.

2) In I10 cell, 
put '=MIN(IF(select the rows under Product Type then press F4 = I$7(anchoring the row), select the columns
under Order Value then press F4)), then press ctrl + shift + enter.
Hover over I10 and drag it till K10, it will give you the minimum order value of iPhone8, iPhone8x and
iPhoneX.


3) In I11 cell, 
put '=MAX(IF(select the rows under Product Type then press F4 = I$7(anchoring the row), select the columns
under Order Value then press F4)), then press ctrl + shift + enter.
Hover over I11 cll and drag it till K11, it will give maximum order value of 
iPhone8, iPhone8s and iPhoneX.









Formula Auditing:

As you do more and more complicated analysis, working with larger spreadsheets,
and especially as you construct complicated formulas across larger spreadsheets, 
it 's very easy to make mistake in your formulas. So, inorder to spot your mistakes,
you have 'Formula Auditing' in Excel.

In your excel file named '7-Formula+Auditing, we see in B7, 
Porfolio Value(USD)  with its value in C7, D7, E7, F7 and G7.

Your aim is to convert those Porfolio value(usd) to its equivalent
Value in Bitcoins, Value in Ether, Value in LiteCoins.

Formula is Porfolio Value/USD-Bitcoin, Porfolio Value/USD-Etherium 
and Porfolio Value/USD-Litecoin.

1) In C11 cell, put '=C$9/$C3' for the formula. 

Go to Formulas->Trace Precedents or Trace Dependents

1) First select the C3 cell and go to Formulas->Trace Dependents.







Fill Commands:

1) In I3 cell, put '=sumif(select the columns under Product Type then press F4,
	H3, Select all the columns under Order Value then press F4)

2) In I9 cell, put '=sumif(select the columns under Product Type then press F4,
	I8, Select all the columns under Quantity then press F4)







IS Functions:

1) In G2 cell, put '=if(ISBLANK(E2),"follow up", "")
	or
2) In G2 cell, put '=if(ISERROR(E2),"Error", "")
	 or
3) In G2 cell, put '=if(ISNUMBER(E2), "", "Error")

4) select the cells from A to G, then go to Data->filter







Rounding Numbers:

1) In cell C2, put '12345.87654'

2) In cell C5, put '=ROUND(select cell C2 (press F4, you are anchoring them), 2)'
   Here anchoring means, $C$2.

3) In cell C6, put '=ROUND($C$2 (select the cell C2 and then press F4), 1)'

4) In cell C7, put '=ROUND($C$2, 0)

6) In cell C8, put '=ROUND($C$2, -1)

7) In cell C9, put '=ROUND($C$2, -2)

8) In cell C11, put '=roundup($C$2, 1)

9) In cell C12, put '=rounddown($C$2, 1)

10) In cell C14, put '=roundup($C$2, -1)

11) In cell C15, put '=rounddown($C$2, -1)
